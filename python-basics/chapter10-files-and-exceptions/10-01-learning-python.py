# 10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. 
# Start each line with the phrase In Python you can... 
# Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as your exercises from this chapter. 
# Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote three times. 
# Print the contents once by reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, 
# and once by storing the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.

with open('learning_python.txt') as learning_python:
    contents = learning_python.read()
print(contents)

filename = 'learning_python.txt'
with open(filename) as file_object:
    for line in file_object:
        print(line.rstrip())

with open(filename) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

for line in lines:
    print(line.rstrip())
