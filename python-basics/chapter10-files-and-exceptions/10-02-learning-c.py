# 10-2. Learning C: You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a string with a different word. 
# Here’s a quick example showing how to replace 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence: 
# >>> message = "I really like dogs."
# >>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
# 'I really like cats.' Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt.
# Replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print each modified line to the screen.

filename = 'learning_python.txt'

with open(filename) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

for line in lines:
    line = line.replace('Python', 'C')
    print(line.rstrip())
